			I think it is really cool with my journey from being a business
			graduate to switching into tech. I really enjoy coding and learning
			more every day. There is so much power in code and one can reach to so
			many people at once. I also love that my programming school Technigo
			is having amongst its core values to get more women into tech as there
			is such a great potential women can bring into the market. From
			designing cosmetics, clothes websites, jewelerry shops just into
			bringing the little feminine creativity touch to every project. I
			believe diversity is the key to bring powerful ideas together in order
			to create something big. If you are interested do not hesitate
			to join one of the great female networks that are out there
			such as Tjejer kodar, Pink programming and women in tech.
